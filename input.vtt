00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Hi there, and welcome to this podcast.

00:04.400 --> 00:10.960
This week, I'm continuing my theme of current events to help you learn up-to-date English

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440
through listening.

00:12.440 --> 00:20.200
So in this week's podcast, some reflections on the amazing event that is the Hajj, which

00:20.200 --> 00:21.920
happened recently.

00:21.920 --> 00:27.000
The Hajj is hugely important to Muslims, followers of Islam.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.840
I'll talk about this, and I'll talk a bit about the brilliance in organisation that

00:32.840 --> 00:37.160
is necessary to host this annual event.

00:37.160 --> 00:42.440
As ever, this podcast will give you some really good, useful vocabulary.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.280
Listen to it several times to help it stick in your mind.

00:48.280 --> 00:54.400
Hello, I'm Hillary, and you're listening to Adept English.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.240
We will help you to speak English fluently.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.120
All you have to do is listen.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.800
So start listening now and find out how it works.

01:06.800 --> 01:13.920
Remember this podcast is just a free sample, a little taste of what Adept English offers

01:13.920 --> 01:16.080
to English language learners.

01:16.080 --> 01:20.360
We have courses for everyone, except complete beginners.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.660
But actually, most of you aren't complete beginners.

01:23.660 --> 01:27.140
You have basic English because you learned it at school.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.940
You just really, really want to improve your English.

01:30.940 --> 01:37.660
So if your English is advancing and you like the podcasts, one way to get more is our paid

01:37.660 --> 01:38.980
subscription service.

01:38.980 --> 01:44.860
For a very small charge, you get an extra eight episodes a month.

01:44.860 --> 01:45.860
Imagine that.

01:45.860 --> 01:51.020
But if you're wanting to move forward from basic English, we have excellent listen and

01:51.060 --> 01:54.860
learn courses on our website at adeptenglish.com.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.580
And if you would really like to understand the techniques that are useful for learning

01:59.580 --> 02:05.300
a language or if your language learning isn't progressing as fast as you would like, then

02:05.300 --> 02:10.300
you will find help in our free course, The Seven Rules of Adept English.

02:10.300 --> 02:16.740
This course teaches you all the techniques that you need to learn a language successfully.

02:16.740 --> 02:20.540
Anyway, this week's topic, the Hajj.

02:20.540 --> 02:26.660
As I've shared with you before, I don't have or belong to a particular religion, but

02:26.660 --> 02:32.420
I was brought up in the Christian church, so I respect other religions.

02:32.420 --> 02:38.860
And one remarkable thing that happened recently in June and which happens every year, the

02:38.860 --> 02:42.300
Hajj, H-A-J-J.

02:42.300 --> 02:49.100
This is an event for people of the Muslim faith, which is a very important spiritual

02:49.100 --> 02:53.700
one. The journey and the experience is a pilgrimage.

02:53.700 --> 02:59.900
That's P-I-L-G-R-I-M-A-G-E, pilgrimage.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.780
And this word is used in a number of religions.

03:03.780 --> 03:10.540
And a pilgrim is a person on a pilgrimage and a pilgrimage is a journey to a holy place

03:10.540 --> 03:11.940
or holy site.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.460
And the act of Hajj is one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam, meaning that if you follow

03:18.460 --> 03:25.060
Islam, this is something that you have to do at least once in your life if you are able.

03:25.060 --> 03:33.460
So the act of Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the House of Allah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

03:33.460 --> 03:41.460
You'll often see this spelt M-E-C-C-A and pronounced Mecca in English.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.980
And the naming is somewhat significant.

03:43.980 --> 03:54.500
In the 1980s, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz decreed that the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H must be used

03:54.500 --> 03:59.180
on all official documents as a sign of respect to Islam.

03:59.180 --> 04:06.260
And it differentiates, as in English we use the word Mecca, M-E-C-C-A, to denote all kinds

04:06.260 --> 04:10.380
of things which are a centre of attraction where people gather.

04:10.380 --> 04:19.220
So adopting the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H is part of a bigger move for English language speakers

04:19.220 --> 04:24.940
of abandoning the anglicised spellings, the English way of spelling things.

04:24.940 --> 04:30.780
We're leaving that behind out of respect and moving towards spelling and pronouncing

04:30.780 --> 04:37.460
the names of places as people in that country would pronounce them.

04:37.460 --> 04:44.260
And in fact, many of the Arabic words, four important aspects of the Islamic faith, have

04:44.260 --> 04:46.300
different spellings in English.

04:46.300 --> 04:55.500
For the Quran or Holy Book, you will see this spelt K-O-R-A-N as well as Q-R-A-N.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.900
There are also many ways to spell the name of the Prophet Muhammad, and you see this

04:59.900 --> 05:02.100
reflected in people's names too.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.500
Pretty much everyone in the UK knows someone called Muhammad, I think.

05:06.500 --> 05:14.500
Anyway, the Hajj, every year around two million Muslims visit the sacred Ka'bah to perform

05:14.500 --> 05:16.620
Hajj or pilgrimage.

05:16.620 --> 05:23.660
So the Hajj is a five-day event which takes place in Dhul, the last month of the Islamic

05:23.660 --> 05:24.660
calendar.

05:24.660 --> 05:32.980
During this time, it is strictly forbidden to engage in anything sinful, that's S-I-N-F-U-L,

05:32.980 --> 05:38.940
and this means no arguments, no violence, no sexual activity, and forbids even the cutting

05:38.940 --> 05:41.620
of hair or fingernails.

05:41.620 --> 05:46.140
Muslims must adopt a sense of calm throughout their pilgrimage.

05:46.140 --> 05:56.220
The Ka'bah, which is K-A-A-B-A or K-A apostrophe B-A in English, this is the stone building

05:56.220 --> 06:03.420
At the centre of Islam's holiest site, the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah.

06:03.420 --> 06:11.340
This is the Grand Mosque, that's M-O-S-Q-U-E, and the Ka'bah is the building that you see

06:11.340 --> 06:18.500
in photographs of the Hajj pilgrimage, the building that the pilgrims circle around.

06:18.500 --> 06:26.980
This word Masjid, M-A-S-J-I-D, means mosque, and the building, the Masjid al-Haram, is

06:26.980 --> 06:28.540
fairly amazing too.

06:28.540 --> 06:35.100
There has been a mosque on this holy site since around the year 644, and much of the

06:35.100 --> 06:42.580
present building dates back to 1571, that's in our Western way of counting years of course.

06:42.580 --> 06:51.540
The Masjid al-Haram is able to host one million visitors, one million worshippers at a time,

06:51.540 --> 06:59.580
and it covers a huge area, 357,000 metres square, that's huge.

06:59.580 --> 07:03.700
But imagine that, a million worshippers all at one time.

07:03.700 --> 07:11.040
And for many of us, we do have to imagine it, as non-Muslim visitors cannot enter Makkah,

07:11.040 --> 07:15.400
and certainly cannot enter Masjid al-Haram.

07:15.400 --> 07:22.080
But this mosque is open 24 hours a day, two followers of Islam who have completed the

07:22.080 --> 07:28.400
pilgrimage, who've completed the Hajj, and Muslims may enter and worship at any point

07:28.400 --> 07:30.440
during their pilgrimage.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.640
Masjid al-Haram has nine minarets.

07:34.640 --> 07:43.240
A minaret, M-I-N-A-R-E-T, is the holy tower from which the call to prayer comes five times a day.

07:43.240 --> 07:52.600
Each of these nine minarets at the Masjid al-Haram is 89 metres above the ground, that's 292 feet.

07:52.600 --> 08:03.760
There are also 210 gates of Masjid al-Haram, allowing the entrance of pilgrims from all sides.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.560
Imagine that, 210 ways in.

08:07.560 --> 08:13.520
And aside from being an important spiritual journey for Muslims, the Hajj is something

08:13.520 --> 08:17.200
that is a remarkable feat of organisation.

08:17.200 --> 08:24.680
A feat, F-E-A-T in English, means an achievement, something that's difficult to do.

08:24.680 --> 08:30.480
So two million people converge on Makkah for the five days of the Hajj.

08:30.480 --> 08:36.840
And this means quite some level of organisation so that the pilgrimage can be achieved in

08:36.840 --> 08:43.880
an atmosphere of calm, safety, and spiritual unity, U-N-I-T-Y.

08:43.880 --> 08:49.880
This means meticulous planning with regard to transportation, moving people around, safe

08:49.880 --> 08:57.560
management of crowds, services of all kinds, and help and assistance in different languages.

08:57.560 --> 09:03.960
This means thousands of dedicated volunteers, healthcare professionals and security staff

09:03.960 --> 09:06.640
working hard over the five days.

09:06.640 --> 09:14.440
The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Health set up more than 250 mobile clinics and medical

09:14.440 --> 09:17.320
units to ensure people's safety.

09:17.320 --> 09:25.040
And a remarkable 37,000 medical procedures were carried out during the five days of the

09:25.040 --> 09:29.480
Hajj without any major health incidents.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.240
So what they set up really worked.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.760
This is really an achievement with such a vast gathering of people.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.320
And this operation was not just at the Masjid al-Haram.

09:41.320 --> 09:47.300
Pilgrims make their way to other holy sites during their visit, such as Mount Arafat.

09:47.300 --> 09:54.660
This is the place where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon, S-E-R-M-O-N, or

09:54.660 --> 09:56.040
holy teaching.

09:56.040 --> 10:02.320
So the day of Arafat, the most sacred in the Islamic calendar, was observed in the desert

10:02.320 --> 10:05.620
in temperatures of 41 degrees centigrade.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.180
That's hot.

10:07.180 --> 10:13.420
Here pilgrims dressed in simple white gowns gathered to stand in prayer and reflection

10:13.580 --> 10:20.380
And again, to facilitate this spiritual coming together, the Saudi Arabian authorities attended

10:20.380 --> 10:28.340
to the practicalities, shade zones, lots of water available, free umbrellas, and lots

10:28.340 --> 10:34.740
of health care professionals on hand, especially to help anyone overcome with the heat.

10:34.740 --> 10:41.460
Spiritual guidance was also on offer from booths, staffed by people able to speak many,

10:41.460 --> 10:42.720
many languages.

10:42.720 --> 10:48.920
And as the day of Arafat ended, pilgrims made their way to the next stage of the journey,

10:48.920 --> 10:54.660
to Muzdalifah, to collect pebbles for the symbolic stoning of the devil.

10:54.660 --> 11:02.480
For many Muslims, this pilgrimage will stay long in their minds and reinforce their faith.

11:02.480 --> 11:08.960
So the Hajj is remarkable, the biggest event in the Muslim world in terms of the concentration

11:09.920 --> 11:15.160
And Muslims are, of course, spread out all across the world, from China to different

11:15.160 --> 11:21.200
parts of Asia, the entire West, including the Americas and Europe, of course, as well

11:21.200 --> 11:23.640
as Africa and the Middle East.

11:23.640 --> 11:30.040
And this pilgrimage culminates in more than a million people meeting in a very compact

11:30.040 --> 11:33.800
space, people coming from all different parts of the world.

11:33.800 --> 11:39.900
The complexity isn't just in the number of people, but also in the many different nationalities.

11:39.900 --> 11:45.640
People who come from different political systems, as well as the different languages, and making

11:45.640 --> 11:52.960
sure they're all able to move in one direction, following the systematic rituals of the Hajj,

11:52.960 --> 11:58.760
as it's been done since ancient times, and focus on spiritual matters.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.480
It's a remarkable feat of organisation.

12:02.040 --> 12:08.520
Anyway, if you are a Muslim, let me know how this podcast was, and importantly, if I've

12:08.520 --> 12:11.400
got anything wrong or misrepresented anything.

12:11.400 --> 12:17.400
And if, like me, you are non-Muslim, I hope this podcast has helped you learn some interesting

12:17.400 --> 12:23.680
facts about Islam, as well as giving you some important English vocabulary to work on.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.320
Let us know, we love to hear from you, as ever.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.200
Enough for now, have a lovely day, speak to you again soon.

12:31.200 --> 12:31.880
Goodbye.
