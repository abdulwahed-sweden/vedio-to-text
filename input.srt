00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hi there, and welcome to this podcast.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,960
This week, I'm continuing my theme of current events to help you learn up-to-date English

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,440
through listening.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,200
So in this week's podcast, some reflections on the amazing event that is the Hajj, which

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,920
happened recently.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,000
The Hajj is hugely important to Muslims, followers of Islam.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,840
I'll talk about this, and I'll talk a bit about the brilliance in organisation that

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,160
is necessary to host this annual event.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,440
As ever, this podcast will give you some really good, useful vocabulary.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Listen to it several times to help it stick in your mind.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,400
Hello, I'm Hillary, and you're listening to Adept English.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,240
We will help you to speak English fluently.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,120
All you have to do is listen.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,800
So start listening now and find out how it works.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,920
Remember this podcast is just a free sample, a little taste of what Adept English offers

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
to English language learners.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,360
We have courses for everyone, except complete beginners.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,660
But actually, most of you aren't complete beginners.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,140
You have basic English because you learned it at school.

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,940
You just really, really want to improve your English.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,660
So if your English is advancing and you like the podcasts, one way to get more is our paid

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,980
subscription service.

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,860
For a very small charge, you get an extra eight episodes a month.

24
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Imagine that.

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,020
But if you're wanting to move forward from basic English, we have excellent listen and

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,860
learn courses on our website at adeptenglish.com.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,580
And if you would really like to understand the techniques that are useful for learning

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,300
a language or if your language learning isn't progressing as fast as you would like, then

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,300
you will find help in our free course, The Seven Rules of Adept English.

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,740
This course teaches you all the techniques that you need to learn a language successfully.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,540
Anyway, this week's topic, the Hajj.

32
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,660
As I've shared with you before, I don't have or belong to a particular religion, but

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,420
I was brought up in the Christian church, so I respect other religions.

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,860
And one remarkable thing that happened recently in June and which happens every year, the

35
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,300
Hajj, H-A-J-J.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,100
This is an event for people of the Muslim faith, which is a very important spiritual

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,700
one. The journey and the experience is a pilgrimage.

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,900
That's P-I-L-G-R-I-M-A-G-E, pilgrimage.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,780
And this word is used in a number of religions.

40
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,540
And a pilgrim is a person on a pilgrimage and a pilgrimage is a journey to a holy place

41
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,940
or holy site.

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,460
And the act of Hajj is one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam, meaning that if you follow

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,060
Islam, this is something that you have to do at least once in your life if you are able.

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:33,460
So the act of Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the House of Allah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:41,460
You'll often see this spelt M-E-C-C-A and pronounced Mecca in English.

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,980
And the naming is somewhat significant.

47
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:54,500
In the 1980s, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz decreed that the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H must be used

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,180
on all official documents as a sign of respect to Islam.

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,260
And it differentiates, as in English we use the word Mecca, M-E-C-C-A, to denote all kinds

50
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,380
of things which are a centre of attraction where people gather.

51
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:19,220
So adopting the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H is part of a bigger move for English language speakers

52
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,940
of abandoning the anglicised spellings, the English way of spelling things.

53
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,780
We're leaving that behind out of respect and moving towards spelling and pronouncing

54
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,460
the names of places as people in that country would pronounce them.

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,260
And in fact, many of the Arabic words, four important aspects of the Islamic faith, have

56
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,300
different spellings in English.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:55,500
For the Quran or Holy Book, you will see this spelt K-O-R-A-N as well as Q-R-A-N.

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,900
There are also many ways to spell the name of the Prophet Muhammad, and you see this

59
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,100
reflected in people's names too.

60
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,500
Pretty much everyone in the UK knows someone called Muhammad, I think.

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Anyway, the Hajj, every year around two million Muslims visit the sacred Ka'bah to perform

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,620
Hajj or pilgrimage.

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,660
So the Hajj is a five-day event which takes place in Dhul, the last month of the Islamic

64
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
calendar.

65
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:32,980
During this time, it is strictly forbidden to engage in anything sinful, that's S-I-N-F-U-L,

66
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,940
and this means no arguments, no violence, no sexual activity, and forbids even the cutting

67
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,620
of hair or fingernails.

68
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,140
Muslims must adopt a sense of calm throughout their pilgrimage.

69
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:56,220
The Ka'bah, which is K-A-A-B-A or K-A apostrophe B-A in English, this is the stone building

70
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,420
At the centre of Islam's holiest site, the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah.

71
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:11,340
This is the Grand Mosque, that's M-O-S-Q-U-E, and the Ka'bah is the building that you see

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,500
in photographs of the Hajj pilgrimage, the building that the pilgrims circle around.

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,980
This word Masjid, M-A-S-J-I-D, means mosque, and the building, the Masjid al-Haram, is

74
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,540
fairly amazing too.

75
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,100
There has been a mosque on this holy site since around the year 644, and much of the

76
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,580
present building dates back to 1571, that's in our Western way of counting years of course.

77
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:51,540
The Masjid al-Haram is able to host one million visitors, one million worshippers at a time,

78
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:59,580
and it covers a huge area, 357,000 metres square, that's huge.

79
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,700
But imagine that, a million worshippers all at one time.

80
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:11,040
And for many of us, we do have to imagine it, as non-Muslim visitors cannot enter Makkah,

81
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,400
and certainly cannot enter Masjid al-Haram.

82
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,080
But this mosque is open 24 hours a day, two followers of Islam who have completed the

83
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,400
pilgrimage, who've completed the Hajj, and Muslims may enter and worship at any point

84
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,440
during their pilgrimage.

85
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,640
Masjid al-Haram has nine minarets.

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:43,240
A minaret, M-I-N-A-R-E-T, is the holy tower from which the call to prayer comes five times a day.

87
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:52,600
Each of these nine minarets at the Masjid al-Haram is 89 metres above the ground, that's 292 feet.

88
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:03,760
There are also 210 gates of Masjid al-Haram, allowing the entrance of pilgrims from all sides.

89
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Imagine that, 210 ways in.

90
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,520
And aside from being an important spiritual journey for Muslims, the Hajj is something

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,200
that is a remarkable feat of organisation.

92
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,680
A feat, F-E-A-T in English, means an achievement, something that's difficult to do.

93
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,480
So two million people converge on Makkah for the five days of the Hajj.

94
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,840
And this means quite some level of organisation so that the pilgrimage can be achieved in

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,880
an atmosphere of calm, safety, and spiritual unity, U-N-I-T-Y.

96
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,880
This means meticulous planning with regard to transportation, moving people around, safe

97
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:57,560
management of crowds, services of all kinds, and help and assistance in different languages.

98
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,960
This means thousands of dedicated volunteers, healthcare professionals and security staff

99
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,640
working hard over the five days.

100
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,440
The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Health set up more than 250 mobile clinics and medical

101
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,320
units to ensure people's safety.

102
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:25,040
And a remarkable 37,000 medical procedures were carried out during the five days of the

103
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,480
Hajj without any major health incidents.

104
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,240
So what they set up really worked.

105
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,760
This is really an achievement with such a vast gathering of people.

106
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,320
And this operation was not just at the Masjid al-Haram.

107
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,300
Pilgrims make their way to other holy sites during their visit, such as Mount Arafat.

108
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,660
This is the place where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon, S-E-R-M-O-N, or

109
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,040
holy teaching.

110
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,320
So the day of Arafat, the most sacred in the Islamic calendar, was observed in the desert

111
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,620
in temperatures of 41 degrees centigrade.

112
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,180
That's hot.

113
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,420
Here pilgrims dressed in simple white gowns gathered to stand in prayer and reflection

114
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,380
And again, to facilitate this spiritual coming together, the Saudi Arabian authorities attended

115
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,340
to the practicalities, shade zones, lots of water available, free umbrellas, and lots

116
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,740
of health care professionals on hand, especially to help anyone overcome with the heat.

117
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,460
Spiritual guidance was also on offer from booths, staffed by people able to speak many,

118
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,720
many languages.

119
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,920
And as the day of Arafat ended, pilgrims made their way to the next stage of the journey,

120
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,660
to Muzdalifah, to collect pebbles for the symbolic stoning of the devil.

121
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:02,480
For many Muslims, this pilgrimage will stay long in their minds and reinforce their faith.

122
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,960
So the Hajj is remarkable, the biggest event in the Muslim world in terms of the concentration

123
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,160
And Muslims are, of course, spread out all across the world, from China to different

124
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,200
parts of Asia, the entire West, including the Americas and Europe, of course, as well

125
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,640
as Africa and the Middle East.

126
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,040
And this pilgrimage culminates in more than a million people meeting in a very compact

127
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,800
space, people coming from all different parts of the world.

128
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,900
The complexity isn't just in the number of people, but also in the many different nationalities.

129
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,640
People who come from different political systems, as well as the different languages, and making

130
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,960
sure they're all able to move in one direction, following the systematic rituals of the Hajj,

131
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,760
as it's been done since ancient times, and focus on spiritual matters.

132
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,480
It's a remarkable feat of organisation.

133
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,520
Anyway, if you are a Muslim, let me know how this podcast was, and importantly, if I've

134
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,400
got anything wrong or misrepresented anything.

135
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And if, like me, you are non-Muslim, I hope this podcast has helped you learn some interesting

136
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,680
facts about Islam, as well as giving you some important English vocabulary to work on.

137
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,320
Let us know, we love to hear from you, as ever.

138
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,200
Enough for now, have a lovely day, speak to you again soon.

139
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,880
Goodbye.
