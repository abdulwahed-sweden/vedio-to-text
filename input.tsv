0	4400	Hi there, and welcome to this podcast.
4400	10960	This week, I'm continuing my theme of current events to help you learn up-to-date English
10960	12440	through listening.
12440	20200	So in this week's podcast, some reflections on the amazing event that is the Hajj, which
20200	21920	happened recently.
21920	27000	The Hajj is hugely important to Muslims, followers of Islam.
27000	32840	I'll talk about this, and I'll talk a bit about the brilliance in organisation that
32840	37160	is necessary to host this annual event.
37160	42440	As ever, this podcast will give you some really good, useful vocabulary.
42440	46280	Listen to it several times to help it stick in your mind.

80360	83660	But actually, most of you aren't complete beginners.
83660	87140	You have basic English because you learned it at school.

105860	111020	But if you're wanting to move forward from basic English, we have excellent listen and
111060	114860	learn courses on our website at adeptenglish.com.
114860	119580	And if you would really like to understand the techniques that are useful for learning
119580	125300	a language or if your language learning isn't progressing as fast as you would like, then
125300	130300	you will find help in our free course, The Seven Rules of Adept English.
130300	136740	This course teaches you all the techniques that you need to learn a language successfully.
136740	140540	Anyway, this week's topic, the Hajj.
140540	146660	As I've shared with you before, I don't have or belong to a particular religion, but
146660	152420	I was brought up in the Christian church, so I respect other religions.
152420	158860	And one remarkable thing that happened recently in June and which happens every year, the
158860	162300	Hajj, H-A-J-J.
162300	169100	This is an event for people of the Muslim faith, which is a very important spiritual
169100	173700	one. The journey and the experience is a pilgrimage.
173700	179900	That's P-I-L-G-R-I-M-A-G-E, pilgrimage.
179900	183780	And this word is used in a number of religions.
183780	190540	And a pilgrim is a person on a pilgrimage and a pilgrimage is a journey to a holy place
190540	191940	or holy site.
191940	198460	And the act of Hajj is one of the five mandatory pillars of Islam, meaning that if you follow
198460	205060	Islam, this is something that you have to do at least once in your life if you are able.
205060	213460	So the act of Hajj is the annual pilgrimage to the House of Allah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
213460	221460	You'll often see this spelt M-E-C-C-A and pronounced Mecca in English.
221460	223980	And the naming is somewhat significant.
223980	234500	In the 1980s, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz decreed that the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H must be used
234500	239180	on all official documents as a sign of respect to Islam.
239180	246260	And it differentiates, as in English we use the word Mecca, M-E-C-C-A, to denote all kinds
246260	250380	of things which are a centre of attraction where people gather.
250380	259220	So adopting the spelling M-A-K-K-A-H is part of a bigger move for English language speakers
259220	264940	of abandoning the anglicised spellings, the English way of spelling things.
264940	270780	We're leaving that behind out of respect and moving towards spelling and pronouncing
270780	277460	the names of places as people in that country would pronounce them.
277460	284260	And in fact, many of the Arabic words, four important aspects of the Islamic faith, have
284260	286300	different spellings in English.
286300	295500	For the Quran or Holy Book, you will see this spelt K-O-R-A-N as well as Q-R-A-N.
295500	299900	There are also many ways to spell the name of the Prophet Muhammad, and you see this
299900	302100	reflected in people's names too.
302100	306500	Pretty much everyone in the UK knows someone called Muhammad, I think.
306500	314500	Anyway, the Hajj, every year around two million Muslims visit the sacred Ka'bah to perform
314500	316620	Hajj or pilgrimage.
316620	323660	So the Hajj is a five-day event which takes place in Dhul, the last month of the Islamic
323660	324660	calendar.
324660	332980	During this time, it is strictly forbidden to engage in anything sinful, that's S-I-N-F-U-L,
332980	338940	and this means no arguments, no violence, no sexual activity, and forbids even the cutting
338940	341620	of hair or fingernails.
341620	346140	Muslims must adopt a sense of calm throughout their pilgrimage.
346140	356220	The Ka'bah, which is K-A-A-B-A or K-A apostrophe B-A in English, this is the stone building
356220	363420	At the centre of Islam's holiest site, the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah.
363420	371340	This is the Grand Mosque, that's M-O-S-Q-U-E, and the Ka'bah is the building that you see
371340	378500	in photographs of the Hajj pilgrimage, the building that the pilgrims circle around.
378500	386980	This word Masjid, M-A-S-J-I-D, means mosque, and the building, the Masjid al-Haram, is
386980	388540	fairly amazing too.
388540	395100	There has been a mosque on this holy site since around the year 644, and much of the
395100	402580	present building dates back to 1571, that's in our Western way of counting years of course.
402580	411540	The Masjid al-Haram is able to host one million visitors, one million worshippers at a time,
411540	419580	and it covers a huge area, 357,000 metres square, that's huge.
419580	423700	But imagine that, a million worshippers all at one time.
423700	431040	And for many of us, we do have to imagine it, as non-Muslim visitors cannot enter Makkah,
431040	435400	and certainly cannot enter Masjid al-Haram.
435400	442080	But this mosque is open 24 hours a day, two followers of Islam who have completed the
442080	448400	pilgrimage, who've completed the Hajj, and Muslims may enter and worship at any point
448400	450440	during their pilgrimage.
450440	454640	Masjid al-Haram has nine minarets.
454640	463240	A minaret, M-I-N-A-R-E-T, is the holy tower from which the call to prayer comes five times a day.
463240	472600	Each of these nine minarets at the Masjid al-Haram is 89 metres above the ground, that's 292 feet.
472600	483760	There are also 210 gates of Masjid al-Haram, allowing the entrance of pilgrims from all sides.
483760	487560	Imagine that, 210 ways in.
487560	493520	And aside from being an important spiritual journey for Muslims, the Hajj is something
493520	497200	that is a remarkable feat of organisation.
497200	504680	A feat, F-E-A-T in English, means an achievement, something that's difficult to do.
504680	510480	So two million people converge on Makkah for the five days of the Hajj.
510480	516840	And this means quite some level of organisation so that the pilgrimage can be achieved in
516840	523880	an atmosphere of calm, safety, and spiritual unity, U-N-I-T-Y.
523880	529880	This means meticulous planning with regard to transportation, moving people around, safe
529880	537560	management of crowds, services of all kinds, and help and assistance in different languages.
537560	543960	This means thousands of dedicated volunteers, healthcare professionals and security staff
543960	546640	working hard over the five days.
546640	554440	The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Health set up more than 250 mobile clinics and medical
554440	557320	units to ensure people's safety.
557320	565040	And a remarkable 37,000 medical procedures were carried out during the five days of the
565040	569480	Hajj without any major health incidents.
569480	572240	So what they set up really worked.
572240	576760	This is really an achievement with such a vast gathering of people.
576760	581320	And this operation was not just at the Masjid al-Haram.
581320	587300	Pilgrims make their way to other holy sites during their visit, such as Mount Arafat.
587300	594660	This is the place where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon, S-E-R-M-O-N, or
594660	596040	holy teaching.
596040	602320	So the day of Arafat, the most sacred in the Islamic calendar, was observed in the desert
602320	605620	in temperatures of 41 degrees centigrade.
605620	607180	That's hot.
607180	613420	Here pilgrims dressed in simple white gowns gathered to stand in prayer and reflection
613580	620380	And again, to facilitate this spiritual coming together, the Saudi Arabian authorities attended
620380	628340	to the practicalities, shade zones, lots of water available, free umbrellas, and lots
628340	634740	of health care professionals on hand, especially to help anyone overcome with the heat.
634740	641460	Spiritual guidance was also on offer from booths, staffed by people able to speak many,
641460	642720	many languages.
642720	648920	And as the day of Arafat ended, pilgrims made their way to the next stage of the journey,
648920	654660	to Muzdalifah, to collect pebbles for the symbolic stoning of the devil.
654660	662480	For many Muslims, this pilgrimage will stay long in their minds and reinforce their faith.
662480	668960	So the Hajj is remarkable, the biggest event in the Muslim world in terms of the concentration
669920	675160	And Muslims are, of course, spread out all across the world, from China to different
675160	681200	parts of Asia, the entire West, including the Americas and Europe, of course, as well
681200	683640	as Africa and the Middle East.
683640	690040	And this pilgrimage culminates in more than a million people meeting in a very compact
690040	693800	space, people coming from all different parts of the world.
693800	699900	The complexity isn't just in the number of people, but also in the many different nationalities.
699900	705640	People who come from different political systems, as well as the different languages, and making
705640	712960	sure they're all able to move in one direction, following the systematic rituals of the Hajj,
712960	718760	as it's been done since ancient times, and focus on spiritual matters.
718760	721480	It's a remarkable feat of organisation.
722040	728520	Anyway, if you are a Muslim, let me know how this podcast was, and importantly, if I've
728520	731400	got anything wrong or misrepresented anything.
731400	737400	And if, like me, you are non-Muslim, I hope this podcast has helped you learn some interesting
737400	743680	facts about Islam, as well as giving you some important English vocabulary to work on.
743680	747320	Let us know, we love to hear from you, as ever.
747320	751200	Enough for now, have a lovely day, speak to you again soon.
751200	751880	Goodbye.
